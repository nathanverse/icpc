Design an in-memory hierarchical file system that supports path parsing and operations like mkdir, 
ls, addContentToFile (append/create), and readContentFromFile, requiring you to model directories vs files 
and maintain file contents. The core challenge is choosing an efficient tree/trie structure to 
handle traversal, creation, and listing (often lexicographically) while correctly distinguishing files from directories.
